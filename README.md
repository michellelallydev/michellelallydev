## Hi there 👋

# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🤗

I know it looks a bit quiet here, but that’s because I’ve been on quite the journey over the past year! While it may not prevented me from being super active on GitHub, I’ve been busy learning new skills, building projects and coming up fresh ideas while preparing for my next career move.  

Unfortunately, I lost access to my previous GitHub account as it was linked to an old phone number, but you can take a look at some of my past work here:

This hands-on experience helped me gain much more respect and knowledge  for WordPress, exploring themes, plugins, and responsive design.  

- **👾 AI**: I’ve been exploring how to use AI tools to my advantage by filling knowledge gaps and staying up to date with the latest tech. It’s certainly been a game-changer for mastering new skills efficiently.
